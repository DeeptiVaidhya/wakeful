                        We adopt appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information, username, password, transaction information and data.
                        Sensitive and private data exchange occurs over an SSL secured communication channel and is encrypted and protected with digital signatures.

                        Please note that data that is transported over an open network, such as the Internet or e-mail, may be accessible to anybody. BrightOutcome cannot guarantee the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted via such open networks. When
                        disclosing any personal information via an open network, you should be aware that it is potentially accessible to others, and consequently, can be collected and used by others without your consent. In particular, while individual
                        data packets are often encrypted, the names of the sender and recipient are not. A third party may therefore be able to trace an existing bank account or relationship or one that is subsequently created. Even if both the sender
                        and recipient are located in the same country data may also be transmitted via such networks to other countries regularly and without controls, including to countries that do not afford the same level of data protection as your
                        country. Your data may be lost during transmission or may be accessed by unauthorized parties. We do not accept any liability for direct or indirect losses as regards the security of your personal information or data during its
                        transfer via Internet. Please use other means of communication if you think this is necessary or prudent for security reasons.

                        business as we, in our sole subjective discretion, deem reasonable. We may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any Personal Identification Information regarding Users with our business partners, trusted
                        affiliates and advertisers for the purposes outlined above. Users have the right to opt-out of any sharing of information described above (unless required by law), by contacting us, which is not deemed valid until processed by
