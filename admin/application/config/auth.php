 | Hash Method (sha1 or bcrypt)
 | -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Bcrypt is available in PHP 5.3+
 |
 | IMPORTANT: Based on the recommendation by many professionals, it is highly recommended to use
 | bcrypt instead of sha1.
 |
 | NOTE: If you use bcrypt you will need to increase your password column character limit to (80)
 |
 | Below there is "default_rounds" setting.  This defines how strong the encryption will be,
 | but remember the more rounds you set the longer it will take to hash (CPU usage) So adjust
 | this based on your server hardware.
 |
 | If you are using Bcrypt the Admin password field also needs to be changed in order to login as admin:
 | $2y$: $2y$08$200Z6ZZbp3RAEXoaWcMA6uJOFicwNZaqk4oDhqTUiFXFe63MG.Daa
 | $2a$: $2a$08$6TTcWD1CJ8pzDy.2U3mdi.tpl.nYOR1pwYXwblZdyQd9SL16B7Cqa
 |
 | Be careful how high you set max_rounds, I would do your own testing on how long it takes
 | to encrypt with x rounds.
 |
 | salt_prefix: Used for bcrypt. Versions of PHP before 5.3.7 only support "$2a$" as the salt prefix
 | Versions 5.3.7 or greater should use the default of "$2y$".
